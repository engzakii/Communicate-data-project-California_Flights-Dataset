You can download dataset from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1AQKp7Vt2-WOXwPjQGwCq_TWbSa5zlyZ4).

- The data consists of flight information for the State of California for the year 2019. Flights to or from California.
- Including variables like   departure arrival and  delays, day of the week,Day of the month., destinations, and more
- I've made some adjustments that might help you analyze your data:
- I have changed the Quarter and Day type of Month and Week to Categorical.
- I have removed some duplicate data so as not to affect the analysis process.
- I have divided the origin and destination of the trip from the figure (city, state) in one variable, to put them in two separate variables.

## Summary of Findings

- Weekend days have the fewest flights during the week which is a bit unexpected as we expect more flights to be available on weekend days as they are off work but there seems to be a lot of work flights  business days.
- People like to spend their weekends in the City in which they live.
- The last three days of the month have less air traffic all year round, while the remaining days are fairly constant.
- The largest number of flights arriving in California from outside during the week is for the city of Los Angeles, which ranks third behind the city of San Francisco and San Diago, and it seems that the city of Santa Mary and Mammoth Lakes has the fewest flights arriving there during the week.
- In the first and second quarters, Friday is the day most passengers fly, but in the third quarter it seems that Monday is the day with the most traffic with a noticeable difference, and the same goes for Tuesday in the last quarter of the year . In addition, we note that Saturday is the smallest day of the week in terms of the number of flights in all quarters of the year, as we can confirm in the second graph.
- For the first quarter, the city of Mammoth Lakes appears to have the highest average arrival delay for the destination city for local flights. The same was true for Bakersfield for the second and third quarters. And it seems that the city of San Luis Obispo has the highest average late arrival in the fourth quarter.


## Key Insights for Presentation

- We can see that Los Angles  has the very best variety of flights coming to it over the entire week from outside of California, during the week, with the city of San Francisco in second place and San Diago in third place.
- For the First quarter, the city of Mammoth Lakes seems to own the best average arrival delay for the destination city for local flights. it also true for bakersfield for the second and third quarters. And it appears that the city of San Luis Obispo has the longest average late arrival within the fourth quarter.
